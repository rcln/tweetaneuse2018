Our scripts take as input files in a particular format:

=== For the training phase :

"TXXX_cat_tweets" where XXX is the number of the task,  associates an ID to a class, separated by a pipe ("|")
    ->ID|CLASS

"id_tweets" associates an ID to a text, both surrounded by "", separated by a tab ("\t")
    ->"ID"	"TEXT"

=== For the test phase :

"TXXX_test" where XXX is the number of the task associates an ID to a text, both surrounded by "", separated by a tab ("\t")
    ->"ID"	"TEXT"
